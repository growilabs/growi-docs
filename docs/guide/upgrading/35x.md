- Crowi Classic Authentication
- [Crowi Template syntax](https://medium.com/crowi-book/crowi-v1-5-0-5a62e7c6be90)


## Basic Authentication Discontinued

::: tip
Systems that do not have Basic Authentication (GROWI admin page) set will not be affected
:::

::: danger
After upgrading, systems that have Basic Authentication (GROWI admin page) set will NOT be protected by Basic Authentication
:::

### Check before Upgrading

- [x] Whether Basic Authentication on the GROWI admin (security settings) page is set
- [x] What setting "Guest users access" on the GROWI admin (security settings) page is set to
  - [x] If "Guest users access" is set to "View only", check the confidentiality of pre-existing pages.

### Alternative Means

- If Basic Authentication is required, consider setting up a reverse proxy with Apache or nginx.

## Crowi Classic Authentication Discontinued

::: tip
Systems using the Passport Authentication mechanism will not be affected
:::

::: danger
For systems using the Crowi Classic Authentication mechanism, the users' Google OAuth Authentication link settings will be disabled
:::

### Affects

- GROWI v3.5.x or above will automatically use the Passport Authentication mechanism as default
- Users that login with username/E-mail and password will be able to do so as usual
- Google OAuth Authentication links will become disabled
    - Users who forgot their username/E-mail and password will not be able to login

### Check before Upgrading

- [x] Whether there are no users using Google OAuth to login
    - [x] Among the users that do, whether they remember their username/E-mail and password
        - [x] Among the users that forgot, reissue a new password and check whether they can login
- [x] Before upgrading to versions beyond v3.5, whether a period of time can be prepared to switch to the Passport Authentication mechanism

### Alternative Means

- After switching to the Passport Authentication mechanism, newly set up Google OAuth on the admin (security settings) page


## Crowi Template syntax Discontinued
