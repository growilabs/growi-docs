## What is a Storage Option?

- A storage option is an option that allows you to upgrade the amount of standard storage[^1] (e.g., standard 100MB for a free plan) provided by GROWI.cloud by purchasing it.
- Storage options can be purchased in 20GB increments. A maximum of 5 (100GB) can be purchased.

    â€»Please contact us if you would like to purchase more than 6 (120GB).

If you do not use the standard storage provided by GROWI.cloud, you will need to configure your file upload settings separately.
For details on file upload settings, please click   [Attachment Storage Location](/en/cloud/AttachmentStorageLocation.html)

## Post-Purchase Setup

- There is no need to configure any particular settings. After purchasing the storage option, the GROWI App will be automatically restarted on GROWI.cloud and the settings will be applied.

## Method to Check Storage Usage

- The storage usage can be checked from the "Account Statistics" section on the [GROWI.cloud Dashboard](https://growi.cloud/my).

## Downgrading Options

- You can downgrade by reducing the quantity of storage options from the Change Plans and Options page.
- However, the option cannot be changed if the total amount of files uploaded already exceeds the contracted capacity of the storage option.
- Please delete unnecessary files on the GROWI App or on the GROWI.cloud before changing the contracted capacity.

## For organizations with multiple GROWI_Apps

- If an organization uses multiple GROWI Apps, the total size of all GROWI Apps will be the applicable size for the storage option.
  - If you purchase the option for 20GB and have two GROWI Apps
    - If you use 15GB of storage space in one App and 5GB in the other GROWI App, you will not be able to upload any more files to either App.
