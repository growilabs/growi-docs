# Two-factor Authentication for GROWI.cloud

## Two-factor authentication when logging in to GROWI.cloud

  Our service does not provide two-factor authentication login feature.

  However, using an external service account(Google, GitHub account) enables two-factor authentication login.

  By registering an external service account with two-factor authentication already enabled,
  you can log in to GROWI.cloud using two-factor authentication.
