Rows can also be added in a similar way, by right-clicking the row below or above and selecting "Insert row above" or "Insert row below".

## Edit a table after it is written

If you navigate to an already-written table in the editor, you will see the table icon appear beside your cursor.  This icon indicates that you are editing the table.
