## Insert a video

### Embed videos uploaded to GROWI

You can embed a video into your page using the `<video>` tag and stream it in view mode or preview in edit mode.

#### 1. Upload the video to your page

Follow [Insert images and files on your device](/en/guide/features/insert_files.html#insert-images-and-files-on-your-device) to upload the video you want to insert.

Once the upload is complete, a sentence such as `[sample-video.mp4](/attachment/66dfd1205b6b5996f1b012a7)` will be inserted in the editor. (This may take a few seconds.)

In this example, `/attachment/66dfd1205b6b5996f1b012a7` is the path required to embed the video.

<img :src="$withBase('/assets/images/upload-video1.png')" alt="upload-video1">

#### 2. Embed the uploaded video

To embed an uploaded video on a page, write it as follows.

```
<video src="path of uploaded video" controls="true"></video>
```

You can resize the video using the `height` and `width` attributes.

- Example

  ```
  <video src="/attachment/66dea1c16a8b457ec2fcaa46" controls="true" width="600"></video>
  ```

  <img :src="$withBase('/assets/images/upload-video2.png')" alt="upload-video2">

::: tip
The sentence inserted in step 1, such as `[sample-video.mp4](/attachment/66dfd1205b6b5996f1b012a7)`, can be removed after the video is embedded using the `<video>` tag.

You can check the uploaded files by clicking the three dot leader > "Attachment Data" in the page tool buttons.

### Embed a YouTube video

To embed a YouTube video, write it as follows.

```
<div>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YouTube video ID"></iframe>
</div>
```

You can use the HTML tag automatically generated by YouTube's sharing feature for embedding videos as is.
However, the `frameborder` attribute is obsolete in HTML5, so if you want to set borders, use CSS instead.

- Example

  ```
  <div style="text-align:center;">
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W_OK4TLbvYs?si=52EIj4mRtzoO57V5" title="YouTube video player" style="border: none; allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>
  ```
