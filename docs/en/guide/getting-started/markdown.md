# Introduction to Markdown

GROWI supports Markdown for writing pages.

## Add a header

Add a `#` (hash) character at the beginning of a line to make it a header. A space is required immediately after the `#`.  When a page has at least one header, a table of contents is automatically displayed in the sidebar on the right side of the page.

Subheaders can also be created by adding additional hashes after the first.

**Example:**

```markdown
# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3
```

## Add a list
A `-` (dash) or `*` (asterisk) at the beginning of a line is recognized as a bulleted list. If you write `1.`, it will be a numbered list. You can indent bullets by inserting four spaces at the beginning of the line.

As with headers, a dash, asterisk, or number must also be followed by a space.

**Example:**

```markdown
1. Number List A
2. Number List B
3. Number List C

- List
    - nested
        - more nested
```
