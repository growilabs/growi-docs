### File Uploading

GROWI has a setting that allows uploading of files other than images to a page.

<img :src="$withBase('/assets/images/appsettings6.png')" alt="appsettings6">

If this option is unchecked, users will not be able to upload non-image files when editing the wiki page.

The File Uploading settings will enable users to upload files.

<img :src="$withBase('/assets/images/appsettings8.png')" alt="appsettings8">

If the upload banner is hidden as follows, the File Uploading settings have not been configured.

<img :src="$withBase('/assets/images/appsettings9.png')" alt="appsettings9">

## Email settings

Sending email from GROWI can be enabled by configuring one of the following configuration patterns:

  1. Setting up an SMTP server
  2. Using SES from AWS

<img :src="$withBase('/assets/images/appsettings14.png')" alt="appsettings14">

If there is an alert that says **"Email setting is not set up"**, this indicates that the configuration form has not been fully completed.

### Notes on using SES

GROWI does not allow changing the Region and will attempt to send using us-east-1.  
If region other than us-east-1 is used, consider setting up SMTP on GROWI using the information on SES.

### Sending a test mail (on SMTP only)

When using an SMTP server, it is possible to send a test email to verify that the email settings are working.

After updating the SMTP server settings, press the **Send a test email** button.

- If successful, the message "Success to send a test-email" will be displayed.
- If it fails, "Failed to send a test email using SMTP. Please check your settings." will be displayed.

If the email settings are enabled, the email will be sent from GROWI.

### Mail sending function

The following is the **Temporarily issue a new user** window in the User Management menu.

<img :src="$withBase('/assets/images/appsettings15.png')" alt="appsettings15">

Check the **Send invitation email** checkbox to make the email work.  
If the settings are not configured correctly, the email will not work.

Settings are required when using Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage.
 Please refer to the following to complete it.

### Set up Amazon S3 Bucket

Here are the steps to set up a connection to Amazon S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service).

#### Get AWS credentials

<details><summary>When creating a new IAM User (recommended)</summary>

1. Sign in to [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
2. Navigate to the [IAM User page](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users).
3. Create a user.
    - User name: Any
    - Provide user access to the AWS Management Console: Off
    - Set permissions: Press "Next" without making any configurations.
4. Select the user you created.
5. Security Credentials -> Access keys -> Create access key
6. Select JSON in the policy editor and add the following:

```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": [
				"s3:PutObject",
				"s3:PutObjectAcl",
				"s3:GetObject"
			],
			"Resource": [
				"arn:aws:s3:::*/*"
			]
		}
	]
}
```

::: tip
It is more secure to replace the first * in the Resource with the name of S3 Bucket that you will create later.  
example:`"arn:aws:s3:::growi-attachment-bucket/*"`
:::

7. Enter any name for the policy name and create the policy. 
8. User details -> Security credentials -> Access keys -> Create access key
9. Select Other and create access key.
10. Store the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

 select [My Security Credentials](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/security_credentials)
from the dropdown that appears when clicking on the account name in the upper right corner of the navigation bar.
2. Expand "Access Key (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key)",
 create and store the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for the AWS account.
3. Expand "Account ID" to comfirm the valid user ID.

In this case, please check all types of authority.

::: tip
When using a private S3 Bucket (with ACLs disabled and all public access blocked), you should set the environment valiable `S3_BUCKET_ACLS_DISABLE=true` when launching growi.
:::
