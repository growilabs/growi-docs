# LDAP Integration

## Overview

Registering an LDAP server allows users to login via LDAP.

## LDAP Server Settings

1. Access the Security Settings page (/admin/security) on the administration page and open the LDAP tag in the Authentication Mechanism Settings.

2. Turn on the "Enable LDAP" switch and enter the necessary information.

- Server URL: Enter the URL in the format `ldaps://host:port/BaseDN`.
  - Schema should be `ldap` or `ldaps`.
  - Port is optional.
- Binding mode: Choose the behavior when connecting to an LDAP server to search for users.
  - Manager Bind: This mode allows you to set a specific DN in advance and use it to search for LDAP users. Select this mode to have permissions such as `uid=admin`.
  - User Bind: A mode in which a DN is dynamically created from the username entered in the GROWI login form and used to search for LDAP users.
- Bind DN
  - Enter the account DN to be used when authenticating to the directory service.
  - Use the format <code v-pre>{{username}}</code> for User Bind to use the username entered at login.
    - Example: <code v-pre>uid={{username}},dc=example,dc=com</code>
- Bind DN Password
  - For Manager Bind only, enter the password to use. (Note: MongoDB will store the plaintext password for the DN in MongoDB).
  - For User Bind, the login password is used.
- Search Filter
  - Search filters can be used to uniquely determine the user to be authenticated.
  - Use the format <code v-pre>{{username}}</code> to use the login username.
  - If left blank, <code v-pre>(uid={{username}})</code> will be used.
  - Example 1: <code v-pre>(uid={{username}})</code>
    - Selects LDAP users whose username entered in the login form matches the uid attribute.
  - Example 2: <code v-pre>(|(uid={{username}})(mail={{username}}))</code>
    - Selects LDAP users whose username entered in the login form matches the uid or mail attribute.
  - Example 3: <code v-pre>(&(uid={{username}})(memberOf=cn=manager,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com))</code>
    - Narrow down the accessible users.

3. Confirm that the settings have been applied.

- Log out and access the login screen (/login).
- If you can login with the account registered in the LDAP, the configuration is complete.

## Attribute Mapping (optional)

When creating a new GROWI account based on an LDAP account, the user can specify which values (`uid`, `cn`, etc.) of the LDAP account should be associated with the following information in the GROWI account.

- username: By default, the `uid` of the LDAP account is applied. (Once an account is created, username cannot be changed.)
- Mail: By default, `mail` of the LDAP account is applied.
- Name: If not specified, Name is left blank.

To automatically associate a newly logged-in user with a local account whose `username` matches the user's, check the `Automatically bind external accounts newly logged in to local accounts when username match` checkbox. (Note: Please be careful about security, since a matching username is considered to be the same user)

## Group Search Filters (optional)

Enables login only if a posixGroup exists that meets the specified criteria. To enable this feature, set the following values in the LDAP tag in the authentication mechanism settings on the security settings page.

- Group Search Base DN: The DN to be treated as the base DN when searching for groups.
  Example: `ou=group,dc=example,dc=com`
- Group Search Filter: The query to use for group filtering. Only when a group hits this query will the LDAP login succeed. Use <code v-pre>{{dn}}</code> to replace with the properties of the user object to be logged in.
  Example: <code v-pre>(&(cn=group1)(memberUid={{dn}}))</code>  will hit a group with `cn=group1` and a `memberUid` that contains the user's `uid` (if the `User DN property` has not been changed from the default `uid`)
- User DN property: Properties of the user object that will be replaced by <code v-pre>{{dn}}</code> in the group search filter.
  Default: uid
