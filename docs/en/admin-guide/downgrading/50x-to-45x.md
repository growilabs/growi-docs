# Downgrading from v5.0 to v4.5 or lower

If you want to downgrade from v5.0 to v4.5 or lower, you need to migrate down the MongoDB schema before switching to v4.5 and booting.
Please follow the steps below.

::: tip
Downgrading is availble for systems running on-premise or running with [growilabs/growi-docker-compose](https://github.com/growilabs/growi-docker-compose).
Please note that downgrading is not supported for other forms of system operations.
:::

::: warning
Downgrading does not have the potential for data corruption, but there is a risk of data inconsistencies in the page's path.
Please undertake it at your own risk as an administrator.

## Procedure

### Work Patterns with a Local Repository that is Meant for Production


1. Stop the production server
    - Keep MongoDB running
2. Perform following steps while keeping the v5.0.0 system available
    1. Start the bash process if you are using growi-docker-compose

        ```bash
        docker-compose run -it --rm app bash
        ```

    2. Run `migrate-mongo down` command in the `packages/app` directory
        - Run multiple times until `MIGRATED DOWN: 20211227060705-revision-path-to-page-id-schema-migration.js` appears in the terminal output.
        - Note: downgrading from v5.0.0 to v4.5.15 requires  `migrate-mongo down` to be run 3 times.

        ```bash
        # 1st time (20220311011114-convert-page-delete-config)
        NODE_ENV=production node -r dotenv-flow/config node_modules/.bin/migrate-mongo down
        # 2nd time (20220131001218-convert-redirect-to-pages-to-page-redirect-documents)
        NODE_ENV=production node -r dotenv-flow/config node_modules/.bin/migrate-mongo down
        # 3rd time (20211227060705-revision-path-to-page-id-schema-migration)
        NODE_ENV=production node -r dotenv-flow/config node_modules/.bin/migrate-mongo down
        ```

3. Switch the v4.5 system to the available state, build the client, then start the server

### Patterns for Cloning Working Repository

1. Stop the production server
    - Keep MongoDB running
2. Clone the repository in an environment where you can access MongoDB in production

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/growilabs/growi -b v5.0.0 --depth 1

    # Get dependent libraries
    yarn lerna bootstrap

    cd packages/app
    ```

3. Create `.env.local`

    ```properties
    MIGRATIONS_DIR=src/migrations/

    # Please change according to your environment
    MONGO_URI="mongodb://${mongodbhost}:27017/growi"
    ```

4. Execute `migrate-mongo down` command
    - Run multiple times until `MIGRATED DOWN: 20211227060705-revision-path-to-page-id-schema-migration.js` appears in the terminal output.
    - Note: downgrading from v5.0.0 to v4.5.15 requires  `migrate-mongo down` to be run 3 times.

    ```bash
    # 1st time (20220311011114-convert-page-delete-config)
    yarn ts-node node_modules/.bin/migrate-mongo down
    # 2nd time (20220131001218-convert-redirect-to-pages-to-page-redirect-documents)
    yarn ts-node node_modules/.bin/migrate-mongo down
    # 3rd time (20211227060705-revision-path-to-page-id-schema-migration)
    yarn ts-node node_modules/.bin/migrate-mongo down
    ```

5. Delete working repository
6. Checkout v4.5 tags in production environment
7. Build client, then start the server

## Troubleshoot

### `ERROR: An env var MIGRATIONS_DIR must be set. Error: An env var MIGRATIONS_DIR must be set.`

Create `.env.local` to temporarily set environment variables and set`MIGRATIONS_DIR`.

The pattern for working with a production local repository specifies `MIGRATIONS_DIR=dist/migrations/` that can be run with Node.js.

The pattern for cloning the working repository specifies `MIGRATIONS_DIR=src/migrations/` which can be executed with ts-node.
