### [Improvement] Performance Improvement in Page Display and Transition

We have fundamentally reviewed the data fetching logic and rendering efficiency during initial access and page transitions, achieving significant performance improvements.


### [Improvement] Performance Improvement in Page Tree

In v7.3 and earlier versions, displaying a large number of pages in the sidebar page tree or page selection modals could increase the load on the browser.

In v7.4, this has been improved to achieve good rendering performance even when displaying large amounts of data, and memory consumption has also been optimized.


### [Improvement] Page Controls on Empty Page

Even when displaying an empty page, some operations such as page search, invoking GROWI AI, renaming, and deleting the page are now possible from the controls at the top right of the page.


## Things to Check Before Upgrading

None.
