### [Specification Change] CDN Usage

Up to v5.x, we had been releasing two versions of the official container image in parallel: the default version, which makes heavy use of CDN, and the nocdn version, which have minimal use of CDN.

Since v6.x, we unified this and released only one version equivalent to the old nocdn version with minimal use of CDN.

::: warning
At the time of v6.0.0 release, nocdn-ization is not complete, and CDN is used to acquire some resources, but the direction of the official container image will be to eliminate dependence on CDNs as much as possible in the future.
:::

### [Specification Change/Not Implemented] Theme Preview in Admin Panel

Up to v5.x, it was possible to preview theme changes from the custom settings page of the admin panel, but this is not implemented in v6.  
Also, you need to reload the page to apply the theme.

### [Specification Change/Not Implemented] Change Code Highlight Library and Theme

The library for code highlighting has been changed from [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) to [Prism](https://prismjs.com/).

As a result, the function to select a code highlighting theme from the customization settings page of the admin panel is temporarily unavailable. In the future, the highlight.js theme will no longer be selectable, and the function to select a Prism theme will be implemented instead.


### [Specification Change Due to Deprecation/Not Implemented] XSS(Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Settings

The value of the "Prevent XSS(Cross Site Scripting)", which could be configured from the Markdown settings in the admin panel, has been changed.

- The past settings are not inherited, but are set to the default ON state and "Recommended Settings" is selected when v6.x or later is launched.
- "Remove All Tags" mode is no longer available.
- The description of allowed tag attributes is now in JSON format


### [Specification Change Due to Deprecation] Custom HTML Header

- "Custom HTML Header" which allows users to freely insert strings and tags into the head tag has been removed to protect the user environment.
- "Custom Noscript" which allows users to freely insert strings and tags into noscript has been added.

::: tip
If you want to include a link tag, please write a custom script like the following:

```javascript
var link = document.createElement('link');
link.id = 'mylink';
link.rel = 'stylesheet';
link.href = 'https://example.com/mystyles.css';
document.head.appendChild(link);
```

### [Specification Change] Mathematical Drawing Library

The library for drawing mathematical expressions has been changed from [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to [KaTeX](https://katex.org/).

::: tip
For example, the notation `$~~$` could be used as an inline formula in MathJax, but in KaTex, it is possible to use a space between `$` and `$`. If you want to use `$` as it is instead of special characters, you should escape it like `\$`.

::: warning
The content of pages saved using the previous notation will not automatically change when the GROWI is upgraded.
Also, please note that we do not plan to provide a method to batch rewriting to KaTeX notation.

### [Specification Change] Presentation Display
