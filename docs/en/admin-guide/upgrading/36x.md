# Upgrading GROWI to v3.6.x

GROWI v3.6 no longer supports Node.js v8.

v3.5 or below has the bug([growilabs/growi#1361](https://github.com/growilabs/growi/issues/1361)) that generate two databases wrongly.

## Node.js v8 is no longer supported

::: tip
Systems that are launched by [the official docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/growilabs/growi/) will not be affected
:::

### Upgrade Node.js

1. Upgrade Node.js to v10 or v12

## Avoid [growilabs/growi#1361](https://github.com/growilabs/growi/issues/1361)

::: warning
This problem is caused in the situation that using `MONGO_URI` with parameters of the form `?key=value`.
:::

### Upgrade anyway

- Upgrade as usual
- Effects
  - The cumulative migration so far will run again
  - There should be no problem in design, but inconsistent data may be rewritten

### Upgrade safely

- Transplant `migrations` collection.
Run following process in your shell that is able to use `mongodump` and `mongorestore`.
Replace `{dbname}` and `{dbname?key=value}` according to your environment.

    ```bash
    mongodump -d {dbname?key=value} -c migrations -o backup
    ```

    ```bash
    mongorestore -d {dbname} -c migrations "./backup/{dbname?key=value}/migrations.bson"
    ```

- Drop unnecessary DB. Run following process in your mongo shell.
Replace `{dbname?key=value}` according to your environment.

    ```
    use {dbname?key=value}
    db.dropDatabase()
    ```

### Check before upgrading

- [x] `MONGO_URI` has parameters of the form `?key=value`
- [x] MongoDB has a database which name has parameters of the form `?key=value`
