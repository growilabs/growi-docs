# Upgrading to GROWI v6.1.x

GROWI v6.1 adds new features such as chart drawing by [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/), detachable permissions for viewing only, and a bookmark sidebar. Many other fixes and improvements have been made to ensure stable operation of each feature in response to the fundamental changes in the v6.0 series.

<ContextualBlock context="docs-growi-org">

In addition, the supported middleware versions have been changed.

| GROWI | <= v6.0.x | v6.1.x |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Node.js | 14, 16 | 16, 18 |
| MongoDB | 3.6, 4.0, 4.2, 4.4, 5 | 3.6, 4.0, 4.2, 4.4, 5, 6 |
| Elasticsearch | 6, 7 | 7, 8 |

There are changes to the execution environment and supported middleware, so admin should check the version used in their current environment before upgrading.

### Build Procedure Change

::: tip
This section is required if you are building from source code published on GitHub.  
It is not required if you are using official docker images.

:::

[Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) is now required as a build tool instead of Lerna, which was previously used.
Since it is not included in package.json, a global installation is required.
Please install it with the following command before building.

1. `yarn global add turbo`

For more information, see [README.md](https://github.com/growilabs/growi/blob/master/README.md) and [Development Startup](../../dev/startup-v5/start-development.html).


### [Specification Change] Change File Save Location Under `FILE_UPLOAD=local` Setting

::: warning
The contents of this item are only required on systems configured to store attachments on the local file system.  
It is not required for systems storing on AWS S3, GCP GCS, or MongoDB GridFS.

:::

The location of the `app` package has changed, and the location of the files has changed.

| Before | | After |

## For User

### [Specification Change] Elimination of `mdcont-` Prefix Automatically Added to Anchor Links

Starting with v6.0.0, any anchor link in a page (including links in the auto-generated table of contents) was automatically given the prefix `mdcont-`.

Example:
The `id` of the `Headers` section in `/Sandbox` is `#mdcont-headers`.

Starting with v6.1.0, this specification has been eliminated and the `mdcont-` prefix is no longer attached.

However, there is no problem with GROWI-generated links such as the table of contents.
If the link contains a `mdcont-` prefix in the document or if the link refers to a document or system outside of GROWI, it will not jump to the anchor when accessing the document.

<ContextualBlock context="docs-growi-org">

Please rewrite the relevant links accordingly.

::: tip
The content of pages saved using the previous notation will not automatically change when the GROWI version is upgraded.  
We have provided a script to batch rewrite Markdown documents to the new notation, please check the discussion below.
