## Handling the user homepage (`/user/username`) and descendants

In GROWI v6.1.x and earlier, it was not possible to delete the user homepage (`/user/username`) that was automatically created when a new user was registered.
(The user homepage will remain even after the user is deleted)

From GROWI v6.2.0 onwards, you can now use the option to set the behavior to completely delete the user homepage and the pages under it when the user is deleted.
(disabled by default)

### Initializing the user homepage when registering as a new user

In addition, the behavior when a page already exists in the user homepage path when a new user is registered has also been changed.
Specifically, if such a page exists, it will be completely deleted and recreated for the newly registered user.

For more information, see the section [Security settings#user-homepage-deletion](/en/admin-guide/management-cookbook/security.html#user-homepage-deletion).

## Check before Upgrading

- [x] Check how to handle the user homepage (`/user/username`) and the pages under it
- [x] Check the case some pages are initialized (completely deleted) when a new user registers
