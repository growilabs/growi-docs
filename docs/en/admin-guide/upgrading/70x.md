title: Upgrading to GROWI v7.0.x
---

# Welcome to GROWI v7!

GROWI has completely renewed his Look & Feel since v4.2 and has been reborn into a simple and modern look.
Come experience the new layout, new theme, and new UX.

<ContextualBlock context="docs-growi-org">

::: tip
v7.0 includes a major overhaul on the client side, and unfortunately there are some areas where the behavior is unstable at the moment.
We will try to stabilize it in future updates, so we encourage all users who would like to contribute to this process to try v7.0.

For organizations with hundreds of users or more, or for those who require stable behavior in daily work, we recommend using v6.3 until v7.1 is released.

## For User

### [New Feature] WIP Page

When you create or update a page, you can now save it as a WIP (Work In Progress) page.
Please see [WIP page](/en/guide/features/wip-page.html) for more information.

### [Specification Change] Changes in new page creation flow and behavior

The button for creating a new page has been moved from the navigation bar at the top of the screen to the sidebar at the top left of the screen.
Also, the behavior when pressing the button has changed.

- up to v6
  - When the edit screen is displayed, page data has not yet been created.
  - Create page data with save operation
- v7 or later
  - When you display the edit screen, create a WIP page with a title like "Untitled-1"

#### Automatic deletion of empty new WIP pages

If the newly created page is his WIP page and does not have a body, it will be automatically deleted after a certain amount of time (48 hours by default) after creation.
However, if the page title has been changed even once after the page was created, if there is a page body,
or if the WIP status has been canceled, the page will not be deleted.


<ContextualBlock context="docs-growi-org">

::: tip
The period until automatic deletion can be changed with the environment variable `WIP_PAGE_EXPIRATION_SECONDS`.
