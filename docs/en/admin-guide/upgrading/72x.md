### [Specification Change] Changes in Authentication Mechanism Enable/Disable Logic

::: tip
This change only affects systems that have ID/Pass or SAML authentication methods enabled.
:::

The logic for determining the enable/disable status of authentication mechanisms, particularly for ID/Pass and SAML methods, has been changed.
As a result, under specific conditions, these authentication mechanisms may be unintentionally enabled or disabled.

<ContextualBlock context="docs-growi-org">
Before upgrading the system, check if you have set the following environment variables. [For details about environment variables, please refer to this page.](/en/admin-guide/admin-cookbook/env-vars.html)

- `LOCAL_STRATEGY_ENABLED`
- `SAML_ENABLED`

**If you haven't set the above environment variables, you won't be affected by this change.**

If you have set the above environment variables, please proceed with the following steps:

1. Access `/login` using a private browser to verify if the enable/disable status of ID/Pass and SAML authentication matches your expected configuration.
1. If they match, **you won't be affected by this change.**
1. If they don't match, take one of the following measures:
    1. Prioritize DB values (recommended)
        1. Navigate to the "Security Settings" page in the admin panel and toggle ON/OFF to save the correct enable/disable status in the database
        1. Remove the environment variables `LOCAL_STRATEGY_ENABLED` and `SAML_ENABLED`
        1. Restart the server
    1. Prioritize environment variable values
        1. Delete documents with `key: 'security:passport-local:isEnabled'` and `key: 'security:passport-saml:isEnabled'` from the configs collection in the database
        1. Restart the server

<ContextualBlock context="help-growi-cloud">

After upgrading the system, access `/login` using a private browser to verify if the enable/disable status of ID/Pass and SAML authentication matches your expected configuration.

If they match, you won't be affected by this change.

**If they don't match, please [contact us](https://growi.cloud/contact).**

### [New Feature] OpenTelemetry Support (Beta)

GROWI v7.2.0 introduces beta support for sending telemetry data to OpenTelemetry collectors.
This data collection enables early problem detection, performance optimization, and UI improvements.
Through this feature, you can contribute to this open-source software as a valuable data provider supporting GROWI's evolution.

As this feature is in beta, it is disabled by default.
When enabled, data will be sent to a secure analytics platform provided by [GROWI, Inc.](https://growi.co.jp),
allowing you to participate in GROWI's continuous improvement program.
In future versions, we are implementing stricter anonymization of transmitted data,
and plan to enable this feature by default once it meets our development team's quality standards.

To accommodate organization-specific analytics needs, administrators can configure the OpenTelemetry collector destination to their own servers.

We welcome feedback from the early development stage to further improve GROWI. If you'd like to help, please join this improvement program.

For more information, please see [Telemetry](/en/admin-guide/telemetry.html).
