# Setup with Audit Log

How to make the [audit log](/en/admin-guide/management-cookbook/audit-log.html) available and what logs to collect.

## Enabling the Audit Log

To enable the Audit Log, set the environment variable `AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED` to `true`. From the moment you set `true`, log collection, display, and retrieval will be enabled.

## Log types

The logs collected by GROWI are divided into three groups: `SMALL`, `MEDIUM`, and `LARGE`. The default is `SMALL`, which can be changed from the environment variable `AUDIT_LOG_ACTION_GROUP_SIZE`.

| | `SMALL` | `MEDIUM` | `LARGE` |
| ------------------- | :----------: | :----------: | :----------: |
| Login, Logout,<br>Create Page, Delete Page | ⭕️ | ⭕️ | ⭕️ |
| All operations performed by ordinary users[^exclude-viewing] | ❌ | ⭕️ | ⭕️ |
| All operations performed by the admin user | ❌ | ❌ | ⭕️ |

[^exclude-viewing]: "All operations performed by ordinary users" does not include the event for page viewing (`ACTION_PAGE_VIEW`). To record it, please add the event indipendently with `AUDIT_LOG_ADDITIONAL_ACTIONS`.

## Add/Exclude logs to be collected

Actions included/excluded in the group set in `AUDIT_LOG_ACTION_GROUP_SIZE` can be added/excluded individually.

- Actions not included in the set group can be added/excluded individually.
  - Specify the environment variable `AUDIT_LOG_ADDITIONAL_ACTIONS` in CSV format (comma separated string)
  - Example: `AUDIT_LOG_ADDITIONAL_ACTIONS=PAGE_VIEW,USER_PASSWORD_UPDATE`.
- Exclude actions in a configured group individually
  - Specify the environment variable `AUDIT_LOG_EXCLUDE_ACTIONS` in CSV format (comma separated string)
  - Example: `AUDIT_LOG_EXCLUDE_ACTIONS=PAGE_CREATE,USER_LOGOUT`.
