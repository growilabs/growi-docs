## Cautionary points about importing/exporting data

:::danger
In case of load balancing multiple GROWI apps, data imports/exports may not work properly because these use the file system.
:::


Data imports/exports expand the following data on the file system.

- "GROWI Archive File" uploaded by "Import GROWI archive" on the "Import Data" page(`/admin/importer`)
- "Exported Archive Data" on the "Export Archive Data" page(`/admin/export`)

Therefore, data imports/exports are not recommended with load balancing multiple GROWI apps.

When backing up data, [mongodb-awesome-backup](./mongodb-backup.md) is recommended instead of exporting the archive.
