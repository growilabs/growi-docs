## GUI Client for Git

::: tip WESEEK Rule
Developers who are not used to Git functionality (branches, reset, rebase) should use a GUI client.
GUI clients make it easy to develop while keeping in mind the tree structure of the Git repository and
related considerations

2. Set up SourceTree
    1. Open a terminal using SourceTree
    2. Disable autoCRLF
        * Copy-paste this command into the terminal: `git config --global core.autoCRLF false`

## GUI Client for MongoDB

1. Install [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/download)




## Install an execution environment for docker and docker-compose

:::: tabs

::: tab "Windows" id="tab-docker-win"

â€»These settings are not compatible with Virtualbox

1. Set up the environment for use with WSL2
    1. Install the [WSL2 Linux Kernel Package](https://docs.microsoft.com/ja-jp/windows/wsl/wsl2-kernel)
    1. Open PowerShell with administrator privileges and execute the following:

        ```bash
        # Disable Hyper-V
        Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName $("Microsoft-Hyper-V")
        # Enable WSL
        Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName $("VirtualMachinePlatform", "Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux")
        ```

    1. Install Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store
        * Install the "Ubuntu" package (with no version number in the title)
            * The latest version (20.04 as of this writing) will automatically be installed
        * Set up your user account and log in
        * Confirmation

            ```bash
            > wsl -l -v
            NAME      STATE           VERSION
            * Ubuntu    Stopped         2
            ```

        * If the VERSION says 1, execute `wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2` to change the distribution.
    1. Limit memory size due to the issue that WSL 2 consumes massive amounts of RAM ([microsoft/WSL#4166](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4166))
        * Edit or create `C:\Users\YourAccout\.wslconfig`

        ```
        [wsl2]
        memory=6GB
        swap=0
        ```

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

:::

::: tab "Mac" id="tab-docker-mac"

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
    1. Increase the RAM because of 2 GB runtime memory is set by default.
        * Reference: [Get started with Docker Desktop for Mac | Resources](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#resources)

## Git Setup

Devcontainer will automatically inherit settings from Docker.  
These settings must be set up on the host side.

:::: tabs

::: tab "Windows" id="tab-git-configuration-win"

1. In a WSL2 terminal on the docker host machine, execute the following commands

    ```bash
    # name, email settings
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "yourname@example.com"
    # If you are using Windows, you will also need to set up a credential helper for WSL to reference the local machines settings
    git config --global credential.helper "/mnt/c/Program\ Files/Git/mingw64/libexec/git-core/git-credential-manager.exe"
    ```

1. In order to use the credential helper, you will need the following settings:
