## First Time

### Clone the Repository

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/weseek/growi.git
```

### Confirm Versions

See [Getting Started#Confirm Versions](dev-env.md#confirm-versions)

### Set up Datastore for Development

Execute the following command in Docker environment.

::: tip
For Windows, execute the command in the Linux VM set up in [Getting Started#Set up Dependent Middlewares](dev-env.md#set-up-dependent-middlewares).

Install if there is no docker-compose command.  
[docker docs Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
:::

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/weseek/growi-docker-compose.git
cd growi-docker-compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

The following containers should be launched.

| Product | Port | Desc |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| MongoDB | 27017 |  |
| ElasticSearch | 9200 |  |

### Install Dependencies

``` bash
yarn
```

::: danger

1. `yarn build` does the following.
   1. Build clients assets and launch webpack-dev-server.
   2. Detect changes in client-side files and auto-rebuild the client assets.

   1. Launch Express server.
   2. Detect changes in server-side files and auto-restart the Express server.

Each process can be ended with `Ctrl-C`.

## Second Time On

See [First Time](#first-time), and follow the step below.

1. Confirm Versions
2. Set up Datastore for Development
3. Install Dependencies
4. Migration
5. Lauch Front-end and Back-end Server
